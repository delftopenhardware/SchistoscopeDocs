# Sub Assembly - Limit switches

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

1. Mount the limit switch to the Z end stops as shown in the image below. Use 2 M2 screws to fasten them together.  
Note: the limit switch is mounted on the opposite side of the 3D printed part when mounted on the scope.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/FrameAssembly/zlimit2.svg')} alt="Image" width="500"/>

1. Make sure that the distance between the limit switches is equal to 50mm. Try to align them to the edges of the motor slide as shown in the image below.
Adjust the motor slide, the end stop so that the objective lens does not touch the sample stage at the very bottom and the Raspberry Pi camera doesn't hit the top.

1. Mount the limit switch to the X end stops as shown in the image below. Use 2 M2 screws to fasten them together. Follow the same procedure as the Z end stops to mount the limit switches. Repeat the procedure for the second X end stop.
Note: the limit switch is mounted on the opposite side of the 3D printed part when mounted on the scope.

1. Make sure that the limit swtiches are mounted at the same height as sample stage.

1. Follow the same procedure for the Y end stops. Refer the image below for more details.
