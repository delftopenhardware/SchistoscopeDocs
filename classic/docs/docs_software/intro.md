# Software and Software documentation
## Raspberry Pi Image

Here you can find the original image for the raspberry pi 4b 4gb RAM, use a 16gb sd card or bigger.  
https://zenodo.org/records/10211154

You can follow this guide to flash the image to the sd card:

Ultimately in the future we would like to have a script that will flash the image for you, but for now you will have to do with the image.
