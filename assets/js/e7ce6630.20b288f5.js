The core of the Schistoscope is a smart imaging platform composed of a locally available low-cost Android device, a low-cost imaging lens, and image recognition and classification algorithm. For sample preparation, 10 ml of urine will be dropped using a syringe through locally available filter material which is positioned on a plastic sample holder. The sample holder and the smartphone will be inserted in an \u2018integration box\u2019 to position the camera lens exactly above the sample.
